I've worked many different jobs, which has helped broaden my skills and talents. I graduated from Utah State University in May 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in English, Creative Writing emphasis. I always strive to work above and beyond expectations and am a quick learner. I adapt well to new situations and work well independently and in a group setting. I believe that hard work reaps benefits for the self and the employer. My life goal is to be a successful author, but I love to share my talents and personality in every job I work. I am currently intensively studying web development through the University of Utah. In my spare time I make videos for my Youtube channel and work on my many different books!</p>
